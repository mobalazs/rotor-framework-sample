# Rotor POC Application

### Introduction

This project started out as a hobby, aiming to enhance - or at least maintain - my programming skills. There's no doubt that the Roku platform and development are my passions. After 5-6 months of nighttime and weekend development (with only leisure time available alongside my full-time job), I explored several well-known frameworks. I wanted to blend a modern top-level architecture with my well-functioning View Builder. Surprisingly, the tool I created was similar to Flutter, using remarkably similar terminology. It's been two months since then, and I've implemented a multi-threaded MVI architecture. Development continues...

I hope you will enjoy the early stage of this framework which would provide new approach of developing complex roku applications.

### POC application

The aim of the Proof of Concept Application is to comprehensively showcase the capabilities of the framework, open up the wide horizon of usability, and implement examples.

#### Roadmap:

- Framework source must be outsourced - from this repository - into a separate repository once the framework's R&D is completed.

    #### Framework R&D todos:
    - Animator lib
    - Code Quality Improvements
    - More comments in code
    - Unit tests
    - Documentation, Guide

- The POC application should evolve into a business-ready white-label application.
- Unifiable ViewModels - implemented in the application - should be outsourced into a separate component (widget) library.

#### How to run POC App
- Rename `.vscode/sample.settings.json` to `.vscode/settings.json`
- Rename `sample.env` to `.env`
    - Set variable: `ROKU_DEV_TARGET=<your Roku device's local IP>`
    - Set variable: `ROKU_DEV_PASS=<device developer password>`
 
- Run `npm install`
- Use VSCode Launch > Run Debug | Run Tests
